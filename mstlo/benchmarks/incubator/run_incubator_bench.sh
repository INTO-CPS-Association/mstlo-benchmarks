#   1. replay the signal through the monitors and derive the dataset
#   2. time mstlo-python and RTAMT on that signal
#   3. time the native Rust monitor, record its memory footprint, and take a
#      separate single pass for the cache sizes
#   4. draw the figures

# RTAMT has to be installed; see ../synthetic_signal/README.md for the build.
